# Comic Border

More experiments with the Mega65. A very simple demo using the side border for screen transitions. Nothing too technical but I think looks interesting and a bit of fun.
I call it "Comic Border" in tribute to the great musical accompaniment. 
See source code for comments.

## Building and Running

To assemble this example, please use C64 Studio (https://github.com/GeorgRottensteiner/C64Studio)

Converting the source to other assemblers, e.g. Kick, should be an easy exercise.
